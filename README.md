# Equiease-Solution-Challenge

### Introduction

Equiease is a web application drug recommendation system designed to bridge the healthcare gap in rural areas by empowering nurses with a robust tool that not only streamlines the prescription process but also fosters collaboration with doctors, ultimately leading to more timely and effective healthcare interventions. It is used by nurses to recommend appropriate medications when doctors are unavailable. The process begins with a comprehensive form that nurses fill out, capturing essential details about the patient's condition, such as the location of pain and its frequency.

- Contact a Doctor: If the medical situation is complex, our web application provides a connection with available doctors on the platform, seeking real-time guidance and advice. This collaborative approach ensures thorough assessments, taking into account all relevant factors, and even allows for recommendations for additional tests or imaging before prescribing any medications.

- Emergency Services: If needed, we give the patients the ability to reach the emergency services of the nearest hospital based on their availability.

For the Recommendation System, we fine-tuned BERT for drugs data scraped from drugs.com website
